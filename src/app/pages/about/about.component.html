        Who are you?
        We are Axel Fuhrmann, a guy who likes to develop things and Talita, the "Rick and Morty data scientist" and hardcore fan.
        
        Why did you build this?
        Because we were really interested in the idea of writing an open source project and also because Rick and Morty is our favorite show at the moment, so why not?
        
        Technical stuff?
        We use Node and MongoDB to serve the API. All the data is formatted in json and the entire project is hosted on Digital Ocean and Netlify.
        
        How can I contribute to the project?
        You can help us to keep the project alive and you can also contribute on GitHub.
        
        Copyright?
        Rick and Morty is created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Adult Swim. The data and images are used without claim of ownership and belong to their respective owners.
